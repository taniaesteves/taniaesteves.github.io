- name: CRIBA
  description: CRIBA is an open-source framework that simplifies the exploration, analysis, and comparison of I/O patterns for Linux cryptographic ransomware. It is built on top of DIO, a generic tool for observing and diagnosing the I/O interactions between applications and in-kernel POSIX storage systems.

- name: DIO
  description: DIO is a generic tool for observing and diagnosing applications storage I/O. It is designed to be used by applications developers and users to understand how applications interact with storage systems. By combining system call tracing, through eBPFs, with a customizable data analysis and visualization pipeline, DIO provide non-intrusive and comprehensive I/O diagnosis for applications using in-kernel POSIX storage systems (e.g., ext4, linux block device).

- name: CAT
  description: CaT is a black-box content-aware tracing and analysis framework. It analyzes distributed systems in a non-intrusive way, highlighting how their components interact with each other and how data flows through the system. Its design enables the capture of detailed information related to I/O network and disk events, such as the context of the request and the data processed by the event. With this information, CaT proposes an analysis of the eventâ€™s content based on their similarity, allowing the detection of data flow patterns that are not visible when inspecting only the context of events.
