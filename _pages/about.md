I'm currently a PhD student at University of Minho and a researcher at [HASLab](https://www.inesctec.pt/en/centres/haslab), one of the research units of INESC TEC and University of Minho.

My current focus is on diagnosing applications' I/O behavior, with an emphasis on designing and building non-intrusive, comprehensive, flexible and automated tracing and analysis tools.
